# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR Image Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

## Project Overview

- Uses the CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes).
- Implements a CNN using the Keras Sequential API.
- Trains the model on CIFAR-10 images.
- Evaluates performance and visualizes predictions.

## Features

- TensorFlow/Keras-based implementation
- Basic CNN architecture (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense)
- Model training with validation split
- Accuracy and loss plots
- Sample prediction visualizations

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
